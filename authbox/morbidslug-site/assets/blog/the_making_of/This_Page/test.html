    <p class="the_making_of--opening_paragraph">
      Let it be known that I, certainly prior to, and likely followowing, building this app, do not have a good
      eye for design. I would not consider my self a front-end programmer other than the fact I can write working
      components for user interfaces, the design and location of those components shoudl usually be taken out of my hand.
      This now being known, why did I chose to build a (pretty simple on the surface) web-app to showcase
      my skills?
    </p>
    <p>
      Most of the programming I have done lies behind the NDAs of my previous employers and I prefer to tinker
      rather than build complete systems. Most of my tinkering does not end up on <a href="#">github</a> or
      <a href="#">bitbucket</a>. Although my first proclamation was of my lack of skill in half of the skill
      set considered neccessary for a front end programmer, I have a soft spot for strongly typed languages
      for use on the web, <a href="#">Elm</a> in particular provided me with a joyous couple of years playing
      around, it has a particularly nice and simple architecture for building web apps. Unfortunately as a
      husband and father I have to provide something for my family and Elm is not widely used enough to justify
      searching for my next career move working solely in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      On reading up on the architecture of <a href="#">Angular</a> I reaslised that <i>each component has the same
      architecture as an Elm app</i>. I was sold, I needed to make something in Anglar, and I had to put it somewhere
      to be seen - what's the point in writing something for the web that nobody will see? So, that leads us to here.
      The next logical question is, how well can a backender who believes they have no talent for HTML and css build
      an app in a framework they, conceptually, like but have no experience in? Let's find out.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am writing this as I build the app and I am doing it without knowledge of the tools and techniques that have
      been built up over the past 30 years of the internet, that's a lot of brainfilling! I just decided I would dive
      in and hope that the documentation and tutorial would provide me the answers I needed when I needed them. I've
      justified this as showing any prospective employers how capable I am at doing things I have no idea how to do.

    <p>
      So, I need a navbar... that's not so bad, right? Everyone can make a navbar, what do they even do? There's a lot
      of questions that I have not asked myself, UI is not a main concern when your focus is API contracts, parsing
      strings, editing and using DSLs, optimising SQL queries and ensuring the structures you have built make sense for
      the next unlucky human to come into contact with the code. Actual <i>users</i><sup>1</sup>? Using a thing I have
      built?
    </p>
    <p>
      Navbars have site names and logos and search bars and login buttons and options drop menus and avatars. Ok, I can
      make pretend versions of those things while I build a site. Wanna see the first iteration? Well, I'm going to
      show you anyway. It's not pretty but it does stick to the top of the page as you scroll, it's also a complete
      overkill as it could be a simple html element and css but I'm writing this in Angular, damnit! Here's the component:
    </p>
    <code class="code--angular_component">
      import { Component, OnInit, Input } from '@angular/core';

      @Component({
        selector: 'navbar',
        template: `
          &ltnav&gt
            &ltspan class="nav-title"&gt{{navTitle}}&lt /span&gt
            &ltdiv class="navigation"&gt
              &ltinput/&gt &lt !-- this is a search box --&gt
              &ltbutton class="login-button"&gtLogin&lt /button&gt
              &ltspan class="option-button"&gt=&lt /span&gt
              &ltspan class="logo"&gt^_^&lt /span&gt
            &lt/div&gt
          &lt/nav&gt
        `,
        styleUrls: ['./navbar.component.scss']
      })
      export class NavbarComponent implements OnInit {
        @Input() navTitle: string;

        constructor() { }

        ngOnInit() {
        }
      }
    </code>
    <p>
      This chunk of code shows one of the niceties of Angular, the <code class="code--inline">@Input()</code> decorator.
      This is used to accept an argument passed to the app element by name. In the wrapping html file we have:
    </p>
    <code class="">
      &ltnavbar [navTitle]="title"&gt&lt/navbar&gt
    </code>
    <p>
      Introducing another lovely aspect of Angular, to insert an app or component of an app into an HTML document all
      you need to do is add an element with the name of the selector you defined in the component (or app). In the
      above line <code class="code--inline">"title"</code> is actually a varable injected into the wrapping HTML, so we
      are passing down the variable down through the templates... it's components and templates all teh way down! I'm
      really excited about what this says about the app's state but we're not there yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      The side bar. Oh dear. This was an arduous process.
    </p>
    <p>
      I like fundamentals, I prefer to write everything myself, because of this I avoid css frameworks like material
      and bootstrap. I <i>like</i> css-flex and that was a problem when trying to make a sidebar that sits still.
      Sidebars have links, everyone knows this and text is easy to add, but hours of trying css that didn't squish
      it or render the following div underneath it. As always, the internet provides, and margins are as handy as
      crowbars.
    </p>
    <img src="flex-all-the-things.png"/><img src="actually-dont.png">
    <p>
      In Angular each component gets it's own css. This is really nice, unless you are tweaking something that governs
      the layout of the overall page. So, although the margins that hold the navbar, sidebar and the real content
      that you are actually reading (why? I waffle <i>a lot</i>) I have dumped these style directives in
      <code class="code--inline">src/app/app.component.css</code>, so you can see <i>why</i> I have the margins
      set as they are (good idea, bad idea? You tell me...). The other sidebar/navbar/content styles live in their
      respective .scss files.

      I am a backend developer. I know, it may come as a shock to you if you have scrolled to this point without reading
      the blog or looking at the way this page has been styled, but it's true. Something about 'CV' says 'put it on a desk
      and have it look like paper'. Is this a badly thoguht out plan? Yes, paper doesn't scroll. Does this look like some
      90's website that should have been redesigned or retired? Yes, but look at the <a href="#">code</a> that produced it!
      I think it's pretty spiffy. Just tell me what images and colours you need and we are set. Thinking about hiring me
      yet? Don't stop now... there's more, but before I get to writing down how I've done it (or even writing the code for
      it...), here's a picture of the app so far. You may need a bucket, be brave.
