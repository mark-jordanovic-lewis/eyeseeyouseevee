### db_builder
It's a tiny postgresql DB build tool.

I'm building this for my own use for prototyping DB relationship ideas.
In the end I hope this will be part of my std setup of a new project as I am trying very hard to avoid frameworks in my programming.
Write config in yml, like the spec templates suggest.
