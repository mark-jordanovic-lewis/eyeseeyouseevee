# routes
### The one stop shop to routing things correctly
A todo list of thinigs I need to implement followed by things that exist.

# todo
- installer so the user and deps can be built
  - add user creation to dockerfile when done
- fix 403 issue
- serve to authBox on Ingress
  - strip and save nginx log headers on authBox ingress
- setup reverse proxy pointing at mock sinatra server
- setup revers proxy pointing at outBox
    - add nginx log headers on outBox ingress
- nginx header check against SHA to look for fiddling


# done
- Nginx runs
- basic setup looks correct but getting 403 for all routes...
