            <p class="stoney">
              Since the dawn of time humanity has struggled to find meaning in existence.
              This endeavour is not only the lofty task of the intelligencia for all struggle
              through life, grasping for their reason why. Why? Why are we here?
            </p>
            <p class="stoney">
              And honestly, if it's not to inject banners, surveys and cutting edge psychological
              tools into the eyes of our captive audience then I really don't know what the
              point of all this is.

            <h3 class="info-title cow">About Me</h3>
            <p class="stoney">
              Ruby is my language of choice in work. The ecosystem is rich, the syntax is flexible,
              there are very few web technologies which do not expose a Ruby API, and, it reads
              easily. I've been working in Rails for about five years solidly, I picked up Ruby
              as a scripting language to avoid learning perl when I was piping the output of molecular
              simulation code into analysis code I'd written in c++ and it's been with me ever since.
            </p>
            <p class="stoney">
              My interest as a programmer, up until recently, has been to feel out different styles
              and ways of expressing oneself in different languages to pin down a good way of
              approaching problems regardless of language paradigm. Recently I've settled into
              four main languages, Ruby, Rust, Elixir and Angular. I love learning new languages
              and I'd relish having an excuse to pick up another.
            </p>
            <p class="stoney">
              The non-language technologies I have chosen to focus on are Docker, Postgresql, rabbitmq
              (though my experience with rabbitmq is minimal at the moment) and LDAP. I definitely
              stack up on the creative side of the programmer spectrum, being an INTP type. I thrive
              when pair programming; collaborating and building new things closely with a partner,
              and, being left with a defined task to zone into.
            </p>
            <p class="stoney">
              I am proficient in git, have used a few CI/CD and monitoring tools and monitoring
              softwares such as raygun, logstash, grafana. I'm familiar with the AWS cli and web
              UI (but I don't like the web UI). My docker knowledge is not complete but I am learning
              more all the time.
            </p>
            <p class="stoney">
              Outside of work I have my personal learning, which has become using the set of technologies
              I have decided to stick to, rather than branching out into new things. I play guitar
              and sing, raise my daughter and work on my projects. I value freedom, family and supporting
              my peers above all other things.
